== Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/ School of Vehicle and Mobility], [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/ Tsinghua University] under the guidance of Prof. [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ&hl=en Shengbo Eben Li]. 
I also receive co-supervision from Prof. [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hhm6ZzUAAAAJ&hl=en  Chang Liu] and Prof.  [https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/ Jianyu Chen]. 

My research interests are optimal control and estimation using Bayesian machine learning, with applications to autonomous vehicles and robots.
